## About CarVision
CarVision is an open-source project developed by Dominic Norton, Ethan Sweet, Preet Parikh and Jiangxuan Chen during the 2019 Hack Brunel hackathon hosted by Brunel University. The mission of the project is to assist law enforcers in indentifing undocumented and fradulent vehicles on the road in real-time.
